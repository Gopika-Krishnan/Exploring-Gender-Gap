# Exploring-Gender-Gap

I explore the different facets of how the gender gap represents itself using data that has information on companies from different industries and regions (inflow, outflow, job category, year joined)

The facets I explore include:

  1. <b>Employment</b>: We examine the number of people employed by summing up the count column and differentiating by gender. We examine data from 2012-2019. This section looks at the data regardless of region, compnay and sector. From this, we see a trend that the number of employees increased over time for both the male and female gender, however, there is a clear gap between the genders from the given data.
